# Multi Modal Design

This course leverages Unity's Learn to Create VR Tutorials to prepare you to create an original VR research project.

Each lab is completed inside this repository. When a lab has been completed, you can
create a submission by recording the required video and creating the required tag.

Additional tutorials and materials will be published to this repository, which can be
merged into your fork.
